[{"content":"The goal of OpenFeature is to create an open standard for feature flag management to support a robust feature flag ecosystem using cloud native technologies.\nThe scope includes:\n An open standard that allows adopters and vendors to easily integrate with spec-compliant feature flag solutions A vendor-agnostic ecosystem for users, developers, SREs, and vendors Unified API and SDK; Developer-first, cloud-native reference implementation; Extensibility for open source and commercial offerings.  Why? There are many existing solutions, open source or not. Unfortunately they lack key features needed for wide adoption by companies and in the open source ecosystem:\n Many SDKs doing the same thing, but slightly differently Many companies “rebuilding” the wheel SDKs are generally open source but have no ecosystem “Vendor” lock-in at code-level No collaboration across vendors. Missing integration with observability tools (e.g. OpenTelemetry)  Differentiators This project is more than just copy and paste of existing solutions\n Current solutions often have eval logic in SDKs. This may require updating all your apps for a new rule type. Config in Feature Flagging tools that are separate from the rest of the app make it harder to use approaches like GitOps. Config and rule changes are hard to integrate into observability tools Information to decide on features already available in observability tools is not leveraged and collected twice No agreed on grammar/structure for rules which could be automatically validated (e.g. with CUE)  ","permalink":"https://open-feature.github.io/home/manifesto/","summary":"What is this project about?","title":"Project Manifesto"},{"content":"Community channels The community channels and project meetings will be established soon.\nGovernance The project follows the open governance model, and invites everyone to participate in the project governance and contribute to the specification.
